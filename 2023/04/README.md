# Advent of Code 2023 Day04  

## Step 1  
More parsing of inputs, and then doing some checks against that data. I went with TDD for this puzzle, and that made things very easy.  
It took a lot of time from start to finish, due to lack of focus, I was out doing chores, working, eating and so on. :D  
But once all the tests passed, it was just a matter of copying a few bits of code from the testcases and voila, the puzzle was solved.  

## Step 2  
As usual a twist on what has been done in step 1, but not as tricky as day 1 and 3 I would say.  
It was just a matter of adding a few properties to my ScratchCard type to be able to remember some new things, and then using some LINQ to query and update according to the new rules. 
I could possibly have made some recursive function instead, but I'm feeling lazy today. I also completely ignored testcases for step 2 and just went right for the prize. :-O
