# Advent of Code 2023 Day06  

## Part 1  
Today was yet again easier than yesterday, by order of magnitudes. Just parse the input, and run a simple calculation for each race and multiply the results.  TDD usage level: 2/5.  

## Part 2
This was actually just adding a separate race, using the input data a bit differently, and then running the existing code against only that race. I was a bit afraid that I missed something and it would be one of those things that takes forever to finish running. But no, the numbers were not that big, no exponential growth or anything like that. Just a small tweak from part 1.
