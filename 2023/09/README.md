# Advent of Code 2023 Day09  

## Part 1  

Calculate the next number from a sequence of integers. This problem was for some reason easy for me to visualize in my head. I created a few tests and just got to building the types and methods for those. I found it straightforward, and the solution just worked the first time for the real input - that is unusual. I usually end up searching for edge/corner cases.  

## Part 2  

Do it backwards.  
Since I built the methods for part 1 kind of robust and didn't take many shortcuts, it was easy to just extend the existing method with a boolean flag for part 2, which calculated the previous number for a sequence instead of the next number. That was all that was needed.  
Overall it felt like an easy day, unusual for weekends - but the difficulty levels this year have been on more of an every other day basis. If so tomorrow might be much harder :D
