# Advent of Code 2023 Day13  

## Part 1  
Mirrors... I was close. So close. I spent half of saturday trying to figure out why I got what felt like off by one errors.  
Eventually I gave up, and on sunday I checked some other peoples solutions - I could not see why my solution did not work 100%, there must have been some weird detail that I kept missing. I ended up borrowing some code from the subreddit, and what I thought was off-by-one in my original code was actually off-by-18 for some reason...

## Part 2  
In what felt like a joke from the universe itself, part 2 was pretty easy to implement - but that was due to sheer luck with my initial idea, and probably also due to the code I borrowed. A few extensions of the code to calculate with regards to the smudges. Phew. Almost quit again.. Let's see what day 14 has to offer.
