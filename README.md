# AdventOfCode

Trying to solve some of the challenges from adventofcode.com  

Sometimes I use .NET, sometimes I use Python. Sometimes I do a bit of both.  

I usually use VSCode with some relevant plugins.  

I do my work mostly on MacOS, but sometimes on Windows, sometimes using WSL, and sometimes I work from my Ubuntu desktop at home.  

I'm most familiar with C#, but I strive to learn more Python - mostly for fun, but a little bit for work as well. Hey - who can differentiate between the two anyways?  
And it turns out that Advent of Code is a really good way to motivate my audhd brain to learn this kind of stuff - more so than boring tutorials anyways :D  

## Test results  

I have this idea that I should always strive to do something akin to "test driven development".  

When I do, I usually fix a badge for the workflow - and if so these are to be found  below and also in the respective year's README.md as well.
